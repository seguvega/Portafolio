      <h1>Welcome To My Portafolio</h1>
        <p>My main mission is to become a programmer who creates solid and successful games.</p>

        <p>I am a computer science engineer from Ecuador. I worked in the IT industry for two years, but my true passion has always been video game development.</p> 
        <p>I have been learning independently, but I wanted a more structured and reliable path to education, which is why I came to Canada—to study and build a career in the field I love.</p>
        <p>My core values include resilience, determination, and competitiveness. I always strive to give my best to achieve my goals and embrace challenges as opportunities to grow.</p> 
        <p>I live by the principle of treating others the way I would like to be treated, and I deeply resonate with the idea that “continuous effort—not strength or intelligence—is the key to unlocking our potential.”</p>
